## What is this GitHub page about?   

This GitHub page lists my solutions to the problems defined in the [Project Euler archives][archives].   
All these solutions are written in Python 3, and every solution that is posted on this GitHub is able to find the correct solution.

[archives]: https://projecteuler.net/archives

## Folder structure

In this paragraph, we will quickly explain the folder structure that is used in this repository.

---

There are **only two** folders in the root directory:

- Code
- Other

### Code

The **code** directory contains all the code that was used to solve the computational problems.   
The file names indicate what problem was solved.
In other words, [problem_1.py][prob_1_git] is a solution to ['Multiples of 3 and 5'][prob_1_euler], the first problem in a long row of problems defined in the Project Euler Archives.

[prob_1_git]: https://github.com/phuycke/Project-Euler/blob/master/Code/problem_01.py
[prob_1_euler]: https://projecteuler.net/problem=1

### Other

The **Other** directory contains extra information or data that is useful for solving the defined problems.   
An example is [help_8.txt][help_8_git], which is an exact representation of the numbers depicted in [problem 8][prob_8_euler].

[help_8_git]: https://github.com/phuycke/Project-Euler/blob/master/help_files/help_08.txt
[prob_8_euler]: https://projecteuler.net/problem=8
